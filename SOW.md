DAQ Scope of Work
=================

Purpose
-------

The primary purpose of the Data Access & Quality (DAQ) Subcommittee is
to enable PEPFAR Community and ICPI members with a timely access to
PEPFAR data and maximize the use of quality data. The DAQ includes a
programmatic and technical focus to:

-   Identify best practices for data use

-   Support in the development and requirements setting for improved
    analytic dataset and data review process across multiple PEPFAR data
    sources

-   Create improved data access procedures by creating guidelines and
    standards with focused consideration to frequency of accessibility,
    usability and learnability of output

-   Serve as the link between data users and data systems through the
    participation in development of the PEPFAR Data Hub, data subsystems
    (e.g., data visualization and mapping) and Change Control Board

Responsibilities 
-----------------

To fulfill this purpose, the DAQ serves as ICPIâ€™s lead instrument for
instituting and managing the following elements of data access and
quality as they pertain to the ICPI and the PEPFAR Data Community:

1.  **ICPI Leadership Support:** Regularly reports to ICPI Leadership
    about subcommittee activities, coordinates resolutions linked
    between data use and PEPFAR data systems requiring their support,
    and to ensure resolutions are *communicated* using the
    appropriate channels.

2.  **Data Management and Integration:** Advocates for and helps provide
    appropriate technology solutions for data access and management for
    use by ICPI members and PEPFAR Data Community, including:

-   Suggesting updates to existing technology solutions, such as
    DATIM.org, the DATIM Genie, Panorama, and PEPFAR Data Hub(PDH)

-   Leveraging SQL and database expertise to export and provide large
    data files not obtainable via DATIM, Genie, FACTS Info, or Panorama

-   Aligning disjointed data structure by defining data architecture and
    varying data syntax for identifying data commonality between various
    data streams (i.e. geographical hierarchy, implementation
    mechanisms, reporting periods, data elements, etc.).

-   Identify complex data linkages; mapping between data streams and
    data element definitions; producing calculated indicators and
    generating integrated data parameters across data streams.

-   Exporting, structuring, disseminating, and providing appropriate
    analytical datasets for use

1.  **Data Documentation:** Takes lead in developing and maintaining
    data dictionaries, release notes, data lineage diagrams, metadata
    catalogues, and other documentation for all PEPFAR data sources
    necessary for responsible data analysis.

2.  **Data Use Best Practices:** Provides education related to OGAC
    policies to guide the appropriate use, validation, access, storage,
    and distribution of PEPFAR data by the ICPI and PEPFAR Community,
    and works with ICPI Leadership to develop and disseminate best
    practices for data analysis.

3.  **Training:** Provides training and resources to enable ICPI and
    PEPFAR Data Community to apply data management best practices in
    their day-to-day work.

4.  **Data Quality Assurance:** Takes lead in assessing and documenting
    the quality of data sources made available for ICPI analysis and,
    where necessary, identifying data quality issues and coordinating
    their resolution with all relevant data stewards, including but not
    limited to PRIME, DATIM/PDH developers, and SI advisors.

5.  **Field Engagement:** Develop data management, processing, and
    repository solutions for generating integrated datasets (including
    MOH, partner, agency, etc.) for better analysis at different
    geographical hierarchies(i.e. priority subnational unit, DREAMS
    districts, site level, or focused geographical analysis). The DAQ
    team collaborates with country teams in identifying data streams of
    needed and their Data Lifecycles as well as frequency of
    accessibility and usability (i.e. data warehouse or open data
    access, dependent upon on technical and policy
    stakeholder agreements)
